# Overview

This is my attempt at learning Java! Which, I might add, went quite swimmingly. For this project, I wanted to expand my knowledge of programming languages, and what better way to learn than to do something you don't know how to do?

Being based off of Minesweeper, NotMinesweeper demonstrates the usage of data structures and classes. At its basic level, the board is comprised of nodes, which are stored in a list of lists. This lets me loop through the board and reference surrounding nodes while revealing and "populating" the count for each node.

Having played enough Minesweeper to understand the logic behind the game, I decided that it would make for a worthwhile project to recreate one of my favorite timewasters in Java!

Usually I like to keep my videos short-ish, but I guess I got... *swept* away on this one!

# Development Environment

NotMinsweeper was developed using the Intellij IDEA CE environment, entirely in Java, using built-in Java libraries. 
# Useful Websites

While these are specific articles that helped me during this project, I used even more articles from these websites to help me learn and understand the important concepts.
* [Stack Overflow--Ignoring a try statement if there's an exception](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8436306/java-ignore-exception-and-continue)
* [Java T Point--Shuffling a list](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-collections-shuffle-method)
* [Oracle Official Documentation--Switch Syntax](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/switch.html)

# Future Work

Housekeeping and future features!
* Enable restarting the game instead of exiting after a loss
* Collect user input to determine board size
* Add a GUI in place of a text-based terminal
* Add an on-screen timer
